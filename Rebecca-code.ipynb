    "Summarizing the posterior distribution with a single distribution instead of a list of individual probabilities has several advantages. It makes things simpler by giving a clear and concise picture of the uncertainty in the parameter we are interested in. Instead of dealing with a long list of probabilities, we have one distribution that represents all the possible values and how likely they are. This single distribution captures all the available information, including the data we have and any prior knowledge we have about the parameter. It makes calculations and analysis easier and more efficient. We can use the distribution to make decisions by considering the risks and rewards associated with different choices. When new data becomes available, updating the single distribution is straightforward, allowing us to keep refining our understanding of the parameter. Overall, summarizing with a single distribution simplifies things, gives us a complete picture, helps with decision-making, and allows us to easily update our knowledge as we learn more."
